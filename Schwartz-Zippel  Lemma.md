A polynomial $f(x)$ of degree $d$ has at most $d$ solutions for $f(x) = 0$

If the range of candidate values for $x$ has size $p$, then the probability of randomly selecting an $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$ is at most $\frac{d}{p}$
+ If $p$ is much larger than $d$, it is highly unlikely to occur
- Further, for random $x_0,y_0$, it is highly unlikely that $f(x_0)=y_0$ will occur
- Further, for a random $x_0$, if I guess the value of $f(x_0)$ without knowing $f(x)$, it is highly unlikely that I will guess correctly
+ Further, if I can provide the correct evaluation result $f(x_0)$ for a random $x_0$, it is enough to prove that I know the entire function $f(x)$

This can provide a concise proof that I possess some complex knowledge

This is also the core principle behind the Proof of Knowledge in ZKP
