## Field

A field is a set where two operations, addition and multiplication, are defined, satisfying the following properties:

- Closure: $(a+b),(a*b) \in \mathbb{F}, \forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}$

- Associativity: the addition and multiplication satisfy the associative law

- Identity elements: the field has additive identity element 0 and multiplicative identity element 1, $a+0=a, a*1=a,\forall a \in \mathbb{F}$

- Inverse elements: every non-zero element $a$ in the field has an additive inverse $−a$ such that $a+(−a)=0$, and every non-zero element $a$ in the field has a multiplicative inverse $a^{−1}$ such that $a*a^{−1}=1$

## Group

A group is a set where a binary operation is defined, satisfying the following properties:    

- Closure: $(a⋅b) \in \mathbb{F}, \forall a,b \in \mathbb{F}$

- Associativity: the operation in the group satisfies the associative law.

- Identity element: the group has a specific element $e$, called the identity element, such that for any element $a$ in the group, $a⋅e=e⋅a=a$

- Inverse element: Every element $a$ in the group has an inverse element $a^{−1}$ such that $a⋅a^{−1}=a^{−1}⋅a=e$, where $e$ is the identity element.

By definition, the field is an extension of the group, because in addition to satisfying the properties of the group, the field also additionally satisfies the closure of multiplication and the existence of multiplicative inverse elements.
